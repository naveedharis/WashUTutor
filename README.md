# WashUTutor

For our project, we decided to create a one-stop tutoring platform for both students and tutors. Nowadays, there are several different academic help websites that students are expected to use. With this WashU-specific app, we hope to eliminate the need for all of these various platforms by consolodating them all into one, easy-to-use app.

From the main screen of our app, users can select to login as a student or a tutor.

Student side functionality:
Students that are signed up for our app will be able to login to our app. There is an option for those who are not signed up to do so within the app. Our app makes sure that all users have WashU emails and a valid password. If a user forgets their password, they will have the option to be redirected to the proper channels. 
From the home page of our app, students can select a date they wish to have a tutoring appointment on. Our calendar function shows the days per week, and students can increment said calendar. When clicking on a specific day, tutors'  availability will show up. Information will show up about the appointment that is clicked on, and students can book the appointment. They can also include any information the tutor needs to know.
From the appointments tab, students can see their current appointments per week. They also have the ability to increment the calendar and cancel appointments.
From the tutors tab, students can view all of the tutors that exist within the database. By selecting a tutor, the student is able to give the tutor an anonymous rating for a specific class.
From the inbox tab, students can view questions that they have sent and the responses from the tutors. They can order these messages by whether they have been answered or not. By clicking the new message button, a student can send a message to any tutor for any course.
Finally, from the profile tab, students can view information about themselves. The profile page will automatically display their name and contact information, but they can add the courses they are enrolled in and a biography by clicking the update button.

Tutor side functionality:
Tutors that are registered in the database for our app will be able to login with the proper email and password. There is also an option for those who forget their password to be redirected to the proper channels if necessary.
From the homescreen tab, tutors can view their appointments that have been booked per week. By clicking on said appointment, they are able to view the appointment information and cancel it if need be.
From the set up tab, tutors can input their office hours or appointment times by date, time, class, and location. They can also add messages to students for the specific appointment.
From the inbox tab, tutors can view questions that students have sent to them and their previous responses (if it has been answered). They can also sort their messages by whether the quesiton has been answered or not. By clicking on a message, the tutor is able to input their response to the student.
From the profile tab, tutors can view the anonymous student reviews they have received. It will also display their name, educational status, and rating.
